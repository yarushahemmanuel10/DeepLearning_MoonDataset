# DeepLearning_MoonDataset

This project explores deep learning concepts using the **Moon dataset**, a 2D non-linearly separable dataset. The goal is to understand how neural networks can classify complex patterns, compare logistic regression with deep models, and implement backpropagation from scratch.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: 10,000 samples, two intertwined moons, features: x and y positions.
- **Objectives**:
  1. Visualize the Moon dataset.
  2. Compare decision boundaries of logistic regression and neural networks.
  3. Understand the impact of hidden layers and activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
  4. Implement backpropagation from scratch for a two-layer feedforward network.
  
## Files

- `Intro_to_deep_learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full exploration and code.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Features

1. **Logistic Regression Comparison**:  
   - Demonstrates linear decision boundaries.
   - Shows limitations on non-linearly separable datasets.

2. **Deep Neural Network Models**:  
   - No hidden layer: behaves like logistic regression.
   - Hidden layers: captures non-linear patterns, increases accuracy.
   - ReLU activation: produces curved, accurate decision boundaries.

3. **Backpropagation Implementation**:  
   - Implements forward and backward propagation manually.
   - Validates the understanding of weight updates and gradient descent.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
